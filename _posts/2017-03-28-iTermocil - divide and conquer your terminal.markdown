### iTermocil
Last week I've introduced to your very neat script called [`Z.sh`][z.sh-post]. ðŸ’– I personally consider [`iTermocil`][itermocil] as a next part of your heavily used dev toolbox. ðŸ”§

#### What is it?
As [official documentation][itermocil] stands out it allows us to setup pre-configured layouts of windows and panes in iTerm2, having each open in a specified directory and execute specified commands. Correct.

As a developer we can relatively often deal with situations in which we open the same set of tools in terminal in order to run specific project we work on actively. Its a good occasion to automate such thing and this is what `iTermocil` is perfect for. ðŸ‘Š

### How do I use it with JustinDB?
Its worth to notice that JustinDB can be started in a cluster - in order to emulate real-world environment we can represent it on local machine as a pool of processes (single process represents node of cluster).

I've preconfigured bunch of different iTermocil's configs. Depends on how big I want to have custer (3 or 5 nodes most of the time) I start cluster bootstraping with dedicated configuration.

I'm running:

```itermocil justin-cluster-5```

Puff, magic happens here ðŸ’­. This is what I see after a while - working [`JustinDB`][justindb] cluster I can test against it.
