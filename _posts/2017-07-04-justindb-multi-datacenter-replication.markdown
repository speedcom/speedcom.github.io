## Preface
In the [previous][justindb-next-competition] blogpost I've declared there that I'm going to take a part in contest called ["Competition with cloud"][contest-with-cloud].

In this post I'm going to cover what exactly I've prepared and achieved. It also has a secondary purpose - it's going to serve as a final presentation for jury.

## Goal
I've written:

`My plan minimum is simple - Initializing Multiple Data Center Clusters on JustinDB.`
`I will use e24cloud + AWS/Scaleway public cloud providers.`

Being now more strcit - I've enabled data replication in real-time between two physical [JustinDB][justindb] clusters provisioned onto two separated geo-regions/data centers. I've achieved that by using 2 different cloud providers - [**e24cloud**][e24cloud] (Poland/PoznaÅ„) + [**Scaleway**][scaleway] (France/Paris).

*Note about cloud providers:*

* **e24cloud** - *efficient polish cloud computing platform powered by [Beyond.pl][beyond]*
* **Scaleway** - *dedicated ARM-Based cloud platform (IaaS) created by [Online.net][online.net]*

## A bit about JustinDB
[JustinDB][justindb] is a distributed NoSQL key-value database. It's written entirely in **Scala** (both object oriented and functional programming language with strong static type system) but what actually allows db to breathe is **Akka** (implementation of **Actor Model** on top of JVM). If you would like to know more about making the decision about tooling read this post: [JustinDB - why Scala and Akka?][why-scala-akka].

Every single data is identifiable by using **immutable keys**. Based on them and modified version of **Consistent Hashing** algorithm all requests (write/read) are partitioned (read as redistributed) between cluster nodes. Such cluster is a typical P2P system (nodes communicate each other constantly to know the current state of the cluster). All nodes are equal (they do the same job/has same role) - we have masterless environment to cooperate with.

![][partitioning]
*Partitioning. All requests are redistributed between nodes based on data identificator*.

To make sure that our saved data is always available we need some kind of redundancy - we keep **N** replicas (replica = data) that are spread among possibly different physical nodes.
![][replication]
*Replication. Single value is saved in N copies (here 3 times). Red arrow shows the direct of choosing nodes (node A is the first one; in our exemplary scenario in case of saving just single replica it would be put only there).*

## JustinDB: Multi-Datacenter Replication

#### Motivation
[JustinDB][justindb] was developed with horizontal scaling in mind from its infancy. Many web applications, healthcare or gaming systems require this to provide disaster recovery, data geo-locality and ability to handle peak loads. [JustinDB][justindb] has come with new possibility to make this all even more available - Mutli-cluster Replication.

Claiming that faults across distributed systems never occur is silly (some legacy databases pretend that). Its typical that in system which consists on many running "things" some of them are not working correctly in particular point of time. The same applies even to Datacenter (yup, thats true!). That is why I've decided to implement one way of Mutli-Datacenter Replication mode - **Real-Time** (there is also full-sync). In real-time mode, continual, incremental synchronization occurs and replication is triggered by new updates.
That way during lack of availability of one Datacenter we transparently send requests to the another one - that way our app can process users commands further.

#### Benefits
* **Increase availability** - even in the event of a serious failure businesses must ensure continuity
* **Improve customer experience** - globally distributed app must be reliable and fast at the same time which means data needs to be served quickly (having multiple clusters we serve data to customers from the closest one)
* **Increase performance** - having more computation resources we are able to handle more requests

#### Architecture

In Multi-Datacenter Replication, a cluster can act as either the:
* **Primary** cluster (sometimes called **Source**) - the one that sends replica to other one,
* **Secondary** cluster (sometimes called **Sink**) - the one data is replicated to; it usually is deployed in different geo-region or Datacenter

We can establish bidirectional replication as well when cluster plays both role to other clusters. In our final scenario however (for the sake of the simplicity) we will keep to simpler version (one direction of sending replicas) where **e24cloud will act as a primary and Scaleway as a secondary one** (e24cloud ---> Scaleway).
