Hello there! How are you?

I'm Mateusz and welcome on my homepage. This whole blog is a result of polish initiative called [Get noticed!][get-noticed] in which you write a bunch of posts every single week and create OSS project till end of May 2017. Its goal is to motivate every person who want to actively blog but never really started do that.

In the couple of next weeks I'm going to cover how exactly I've built (still building btw) JustinDB which is actually a faiful implementation of Amazon DynamoDB specification (the one that was inspiration for modern NoSQL databases) with some exceptions.
