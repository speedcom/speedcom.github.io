## Preface
In [previous][justindb-read-repair] post I wrote what data *entropy* is and how [JustinDB][justindb] tries to solve it. I've introduced to you also **Read-Repair** technique and gave quick intro to todays hero - **Active Anti-Entropy**. üí™

We know that **Read-Repair** is triggered on *read* side, rather than a write. But what if read some data very rarely? It can be eventually be lost! To handle this and other threats to durability, [JustinDB][justindb] implements mentioned an anti-entorpy (replica synchronization) protocol to keep the replicas synchronized.

## Active-Anti Entropy (AAE)

So **AAE** is nothing more like a synchronization protocol to handling permanent failures. [JustinDB][justindb] supports it to proactively identify and repair inconsident data. This feature helps to recover data loss in the event of disk corruption or administrative error.

To detect inconsistencies between replicas faster and to minimize the amount of transferred data, [JustinDB][justindb] uses [**Merkle Trees**][justindb-merkle-trees]. Its a sophisticated **hash tree** which makes it easy to compare data sets between [**vnodes**][justindb-ring].

## Merkle Trees
Merkle Trees is a hash tree where leafes are hashes of the values of individual keys. Parent nodes are hashes of their respective children.

They minimize the amount of data that needs to be transferred for synchronization.

Each **vnode** maintains a separate **Merkle Tree** for each key range it hosts. If the hash values of the root of two trees are equal, then there is no point in doing synchronization since its meaning that leaf nodes are equal (replicas are the same). If not, it implies that the values of some replicas are different and they need to be synchronized.

Since this process can be a bit expensive (think about existing many divergent replicas or just about profilactic checking of hashes throughout all cluster) its **triggered manually** by database administrator (e.g every friday night). ‚úåÔ∏è
