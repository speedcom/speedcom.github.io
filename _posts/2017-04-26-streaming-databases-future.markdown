## Streaming World

We leave in the world where streaming got to be a serious part of building distributed applications. In this ecosystem we face a lot of innovation at open source including such frameworks like Apache Spark/Storm/Flink, Kafka/Samza or proprietary services such AWS Lambda and Google's DataFlow.

Every single serious application needs some kind of data storage in order to store results and get them back later.
Thought, there is one thing that seems to be very constant at this field - **MONOPOL of RDBMs** (_Relational Database Management Systems_).

In typical software developer mindset these solutions seems to exists as the only one even though they simply often do not fit to application requirements!
