## BLOGPOST NR 20
You may know that I'm taking a part in polish competition called [Get noticed!][get-noticed] (read more [here][justindb-get-noticed] about it). It took more than 2 months since I wrote it.

**Time flies so fast.**

But I'm very happy and proud from myself. ðŸ˜Š I achieved my personal goal - to write 20 blogposts (mainly about [JustinDB][justindb]). ðŸ’–

## NEXT COMPETITION
I don't know why but I love competitions. Recently I found a new possibility to move on with [JustinDB][justindb] to make it even more recognizable.

I'm going to take a part in so called ["Konkurs z chmurÄ…"][contest-with-cloud] (ang. "Contest with cloud") which is organized by team from Chmurowisko and e24cloud (cloud provider). Subject of topic is very broad.

#### **STEP 1**. Build "something" in e24cloud
It can be anything even like installing Wordpress site on virtual machine there or some hybrid solution using e24cloud + AWS at the same time.

My plan minimum is simple - **Initializing Multiple Data Center Clusters on [JustinDB][justindb]**.
I will use **e24cloud** + **AWS/Scaleway** public cloud providers.

If everything will spin up correctly I will additionaly try to cover different data replication scenarios.
I will also try to see how **network** failures affect on database stability (cluster forming), data consistency and behavior in case of **Split Brain** happening.

#### **STEP 2**. Show it to the world

Easly undestandable. Just write about your whole "journey" on blog or record video.

#### **STEP 3**. Win
Yeah! ðŸ‘Š
