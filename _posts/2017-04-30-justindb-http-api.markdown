## How to talk to JustinDB
[JustinDB][justindb] its a key/value store - you associate valeus with keys, and retrieve whem using the same keys. This means that basic commands are setting and getting values.

As I wrote in ["JustinDB - Modern REACTIVE NoSQL database"][justindb-reactive-database] one possibility to talk with [JustinDB][justindb] is HTTP protocol. The actions are currently related to HTTP methods (GET, PUT).


### **GET**

Its very simple form of read, responding with only the value.

```
GET /get?id={UUID}&r={r}
```

`r` is the number of nodes read from before returning

### **PUT**

The simplest write command in Riak is putting a value.

```
PUT /put body: { w: Int, value: Array[Byte], vectorClock: Base64 }
```
`w` is the number of nodes written to before considered successful.
`vectorClock` is the mechanism for partial ordering of values in [JustinDB][justindb]. You can read more about this mechanism [here][justindb-vector-clock].
